This is a simple example of how to create a chatbopt from a PDF file.

If you want you to load other types of files, you can change the `loader` in `models/agent.py` to use the appropriate loader.

## How to run

1. Install `poetry` from https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation
2. Run `poetry install`

In case you want to change the pdf you only have to load them in the data folder

3. Load the OpenAI API key in your environment as `OPENAI_API_KEY`
4. Run `poetry run start`
